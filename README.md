Comparing the performance of traditional and deep learning methods to denoise images corrupted with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). 
The dataset used is the Fashion MNIST dataset.

The implemented image denoising methods:
1. Median filter
2. Non-local means filter
3. Wavelet denoising
4. Convolutional denoising autoencoders

The performance of the methods was compared based on the following performance measures:
1. The time to denoise images
2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
3. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR)
4. Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM)
